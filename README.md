## Brief Description: 
Given the dataset of 160 rows – representing people and their data - and 54 columns – representing different attributes, consisting in 5 social attributes and 49 answers to 5 different questionnaires.
These data were pre-processed removing duplicates, outliers and NaN values.
The exploratory data analysis was performed using barplots and histograms, pairplots and heatmaps.
Then PCA and clustering were performed, followed by the statistical analysis to validate the clusters found and thus create the persona cards
